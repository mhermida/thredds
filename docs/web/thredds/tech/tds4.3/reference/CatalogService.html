<div class="head">
<hr>

<p>The TDS provides various services for THREDDS catalogs. Catalogs
served by the TDS can be subset and/or viewed as HTML. Remote catalogs,
if allowed, can be validated, displayed as HTML, or subset.</p><h2><a name="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h2><p>Local
catalogs always&nbsp;support subsetting and HTML viewing.</p><p>Catalog services on remote catalogs are only allowed if the following is added to the <code>threddsConfig.xml</code> configuration file:</p><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">&lt;CatalogServices&gt;<br>    &lt;allowRemote&gt;true&lt;/allowRemote&gt;<br>&lt;/CatalogServices&gt;<br></pre><p></p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><h2>Catalog Services for Local TDS Served Catalogs</h2>
<p>All catalogs served by a TDS can be operated on with the various
catalog services. It does not matter if the catalog is the served
version of a TDS catalog configuration file or produced from a <code>datasetScan</code> element.</p><p>The
path of the request URL identifies the target catalog. The extension on
the filename determines whether an XML or HTML view is returned, ".xml"
or ".html" respectively.</p><p>Subsetting of the catalog is performed if
a "dataset" parameter is included in the request. The value of the
"dataset" parameter must match the ID of a dataset in the target
catalog.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p>The following returns an HTML view of the main TDS catalog on motherlode:</p><pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.html">http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.html</a></pre>The following returns an HTML view of one of the datasets from the same catalog:<br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog/galeon/testdata/catalog.html?dataset=galeon/testdata/GFS_Global_5x2p5deg.nc">http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog/galeon/testdata/catalog.html?dataset=galeon/testdata/GFS_Global_5x2p5deg.nc</a></pre><br><hr>
  <h2>Catalog Services for Remote Catalog</h2><p>If enabled (see <a href="#Configuration">above</a>), catalog services for remote catalogs must be requested from the following URL:</p><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">http://server:port<strong>/thredds/remoteCatalogService</strong></pre><p>The following parameters are recognized:</p><ul><li>"catalog": [required]&nbsp;the URI of the target catalog.</li>
  <li>"command": [optional] one of the
    following values: "SHOW", "SUBSET", or "VALIDATE".</li>
  <li>"dataset": [optional] used only in (and required in)&nbsp;"SUBSET" requests, gives the ID of a dataset in the
    target catalog.</li>
  <li>"htmlView":
[optional] used only in "SUBSET" requests, a value of "false" causes an
XML view to be returned, otherwise an HTML view is returned.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>"verbose":
[optional] used only in "VALIDATE" requests, a value of "true"
increases the detail of the validation messages returned.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few notes on the above parameters:</p><ul><li> The values of the "command", "htmlView", and "verbose" parameters are case insensitive.</li><li>The target catalog URI must be an absolute URI that references a remote THREDDS catalog.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;default
command (i.e., the value used when the request does not include a
"command" parameter) depends on whether the request includes a
"dataset" parameter. If a "dataset" parameter is included,&nbsp;the
command defaults to "SUBSET", otherwise it defaults to "SHOW".</li></ul><p>The action performed for each value of the "command" parameter are as follows:</p><ul><li>"SHOW" - an HTML view of the entire target catalog is returned.</li><li>"SUBSET"
- the ID given by the "dataset" parameter is used to find the dataset
in the target catalog. If the "htmlView" parameter value is&nbsp;
"false", an XML view of a catalog containing only that dataset is
returned (this is a logical subset so the dataset contains all
inherited metadata). Otherwise, an HTML view of the dataset is returned.</li><li>"VALIDATE" - an HTML page is returned which contains THREDDS catalog validation messages (warnings and errors).</li></ul><p>Catalog subsetting is done on the logical structure of the catalog rather than directly on the XML. This means that all <code>service</code> elements are included in the catalog and all metadata&nbsp;inherited by the target dataset are included in the resulting dataset.</p><p>Examples</p><p>The following returns an HTML view of the main TDS catalog on motherlode:</p><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">http://server:port<strong>/thredds/remoteCatalogService</strong>?catalog=http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.xml</pre><p>
The following returns an HTML view of one of the datasets from the same catalog:</p><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">http://server:port<strong>/thredds/remoteCatalogService</strong>?catalog=http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.xml&amp;dataset=IDD</pre>
