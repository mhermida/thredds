<hr>
<p>TDS is configured with <em>configuration catalogs</em> that live in the directory <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/</strong>.
These usually contain some information needed only on the server, which
is removed when the TDS sends the catalog to the client. </p>
<h3>Configuration Catalogs</h3>
<p>The <em>default root catalog</em> is <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/catalog.xml. </strong>It may reference other configuration catalogs using the <strong>catalogRef</strong>
element. These catalogs can also contain catalogRef elements, etc. If
you want to serve other catalogs that are not linked to the root
catalog, then <a href="../tutorial/ConfigCatalogs.html#rootCatalogs">declare them</a> in <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/threddsConfig.xml. </strong>The set of  configuration catalogs is found by traversing all the root catalogs. This is the set of <em>configuration catalogs</em>, aka <em>static catalogs</em>. </p>
<p><em>All catalogs that you want to be seen and indexed (eg by crawlers) should be linked from the root catalog. Only declare catalogs in a catalogRoot element when you want to &quot;hide&quot; the catalog from simple browse access</em>.</p>
<p>The catalogRef element looks like: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><strong>&lt;catalogRef xlink:href=&quot;idd/models.xml&quot; xlink:title=&quot;NCEP Model Data&quot; name=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>xlink:href </strong>attribute names the referenced catalog; it must be relative to the catalog it is contained in. In this example, it would be in the subdirectory <strong>idd</strong> under the directory of the catalog containing it . You can also use &quot;..&quot; to name peer directories:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><strong>&lt;catalogRef xlink:href=&quot;../idv/ncep.xml&quot; xlink:title=&quot;IDV NCEP Model Data&quot; name=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>in this example, if the  catalog is <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/idd/models.xml, </strong>then the referenced catalog is <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/idv/ncep.xml</strong></p>
<p>You can also use a relative URL that begins with <code>/</code> (a slash):</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><strong>&lt;catalogRef xlink:href=&quot;/thredds/galeon/wcs/test.xml&quot; xlink:title=&quot;GALEON Test Data&quot; name=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>which points to the catalog at <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/galeon/wcs/test.xml </strong>no matter what catalog it appears in. Note that the base directory is <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/</strong>, and that all configuration catalogs must live under it. </p>
<h3>Catalog Caching</h3>
<p>Static catalogs are read and cached in memory when the TDS <em>web application</em> starts up (e.g. when Tomcat starts up). The <em>expires</em> attribute can be used to decide whether to reread the catalog. If no expires attribute, the catalog is not automatically reread:</p>
<p>You can also force a reread of the configuration catalogs (without having to restart TDS) through the <strong>Reinitialize</strong> command in <a href="RemoteManagement.html#RemoteDebugging">TDS Remote Management</a>. </p>
<h3>Dynamic Catalogs </h3>
<p>Dynamic catalogs are generated by <a href="DatasetScan.html">DatasetScan</a> elements, at the time the user request is made. These catalogs are not cached. The request causes a single disk directory to be read. Files in the directory (that pass the filter) are made into <em>dataset</em> elements. Any subdirectories are made into <em>catalogRef</em> elements, and are not read until a request is made for them. </p>
<p>A DatasetScan actually refers to a generalization of a disk directory called a <a href="CrawlableDataset.html">CrawlableDataset</a>. This allows dynamic catalogs to be generated for other kinds of resources, such as OPeNDAP servers. However, the usual case is that a DatasetScan has a CrawlableDataset that is just a wrapper around a disk directory. </p>
