 9: (2012-04-19)
  RotatedPole fix (from Robert Schmunk)
  HDF5: add HDF5_chunksize attribute
  timeseriesProfile: allow time(time)
  show table path in GribCollectionPanel show processed PDS
  GRIB: human readable grib names
  JoinNew has bug when groups are present because non-agg vars are not getting proxied.

  TransverseMercator projection: allow alternate parameter names; bugs in km/m in ellipsoid
  Grib1, Grib2 scanners look through entire 16K for valid record.
  NCSS maxFileSize, time striding, allow grid subsetting by (single) vertical level, add grid description to dataset description, web form.
  WRF accept gridtype E. GridCoordSys horiz stagger.
  GRIB Collections: dont sort groups, since we have indexes into them; make them immutable; sort at presentation layer
  CollectionManagerSingleFile: bug when using a reletive path
  RuntimeLoading: fix docs, grib1 table loading, add feature dataset factory runtime loading.
  GRIB: was not using DiskCache standardPolicy
  GRIB2 Collection: can filter on interval length by variable; also filter out (0,0) intervals
  GRIB2 variable names - use NCL-like syntax
  CoordinateAxis1D flipping bounds when all starting bounds were zero.
  Add SwathDatasetFactory - fake for now.
  HDF4: remove "." in identifier
  GRIB-2: fix when lat/lon GDS has lo1 == lo2 == 180

 8: (2012-02-09)
  GRIB-1 ensembles for ECMWF type=30
  GRIB-1 merge intervals
  redo useGenType: use if type == error. so varHash changes, increment ncx version

 7: (2012-02-06)
  GRIB2 useGenType option
  GRIB-1 thin grids bugs.
  GRIB-1 ensembles : special coding for NCEP, ECMWF
  TimePartition by directory
  CalendarPeriod.getOffset() finds difference between two CalendarDates.
  GRIB2 intervals: use the end date as end of interval, shape the coordinates from there, allow calendar fields
  GRIB Collections: if tdsUsingTdm, no updating
  GRIB TimeCoord uses extended date format when unit is month or year.
  CF1Convention accepts extended date format as time coordinate: "CALENDAR period SINCE reference_date"
  NcML can be configured with <iospParam>
  FeatureCollectionConfig.GribConfig can change timeUnits, rename groups, consolidate gds
  GribIosp common superclass

 6: (2012-01-20)

  Grib2: use new screen scraped NCEP tables
  GribCollections: consistent use of DiskCache for indexes

  MFileOS captures lastModified at the time of object creation.

 5: (2012-01-06)
  Fix when earth_radius comes in km instead of meters.
